# cloud-automation-demo
This repo enables you to perform cloud automation demos using Terraform or Ansible

# Prereqs

1. Install golang 1.8 or later
2. `go get golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`

# Setup

Every variable in `vars.tf` without a default must be defined in a `terraform.tfvars` file.  Your github access token can be generated by going to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens.  The token only needs `admin:org_hook` permissions.  Once those are done, you should be able to perform `terraform init` in this directory.

# Running the demo

To run the demo:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

To shut the demo down:

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
